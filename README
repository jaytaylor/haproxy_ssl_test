This is a PEM certificate tester.  The core of this code was pulled out of the
1.5 series of HAProxy.


==Dependencies==
libssl is required


==Compilation==
Run the following commands:
    make clean
    make

If all goes well, there will be an executable named "ssl_test".


==Running the test==

Once the compilation is successful, PEM files can be tested by running:
    ./ssl_test [path-to-PEM-file]

Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and Mac OSX Lion.
